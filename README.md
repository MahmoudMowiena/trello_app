# Cinnamon Trello-like Board Application

Cinnamon is a Trello-like application designed for efficient project management on a smaller scale. It features a single board where users can manage columns and cards with ease. The application ensures secure access with authentication and offers seamless drag-and-drop functionality for card management. The entire application is written in TypeScript for enhanced code quality and maintainability.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel. You can access it [here]([https://trello-gcty7vcwe-mahmoud-mowienas-projects.vercel.app](https://trello-like-i6pc2kcuv-mahmoud-mowienas-projects.vercel.app)).

## Features

### Board Management
